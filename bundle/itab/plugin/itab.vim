" The aim of this script is to be able to handle the mode of tab usage which
" distinguishes 'indent' from 'alignment'.  The idea is to use <tab>
" characters only at the beginning of lines.
"
" This means that an individual can use their own 'tabstop' settings for the
" indent level, while not affecting alignment.
"
" The one caveat with this method of tabs is that you need to follow the rule
" that you never 'align' elements that have different 'indent' levels.
"
" options:
"
" g:itab#disable_maps
"   disable tab insertion and deletion mappings
"
" g:itab#delete_trails
"   delete trailing spaces/tabs when going to a new line

" note: indentkeys and cinkeys partially break from the indents
